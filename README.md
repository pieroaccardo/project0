# Project 0

I got started to develop a professional website. I'd like to underline that it is just the black-bone since I know that I need to implement it with images and icons. Anyway, on top (in the navbar) I inserted an external link to my Linkedin profile, while at the bottom, the footer reflects my details.
Overall, I created four pages:
-- HOME: which displays services I'm going to offer;
-- PORTFOLIO: which contains all the relevant papers or works I made in the past;
-- EDUCATION: which reflects information about academic background;
-- EXPERIENCE: which reflects information about professional background.
Finally, I did my best to make the website as more responsive as I can for all devices (smartphones, tablets and desktops).
